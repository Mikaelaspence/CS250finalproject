How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs in agile are typically obtain through user stories. This can be done virtually via tools like email or preferrably with a face to face meeting that allows for more open discussion. Through these interactions, user stories are created that are used by the scrum team. These help to direct a course of action that incorporates what the users are looking for (or not looking for!) in a product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing a program strts with a plan. If it is a program that involves a team and is not a solo project, the scrum-agile method is a flexible and versatile project management technique. This starts with an idea, then involves planning. Obtaining user stories can help the product owner create a backlog. Daily scrum meetings can help keep a team on task and work out obstacles that have come up in development. Testers will create test cases that are pass/fail based on user stories, and the developers take those test cases to start developing a product. At the end, a sprint review and retrospective are done to see what worked and what didn't, then the cycle begins again. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member involves being open, being cooperative, being somewhat self-driven and being an active particpant. Joining in on crum meetings, meeting the requirements of whichever role they are assigned, and being timely but flexible are all parts of being on a team.
